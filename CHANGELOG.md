# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Safe email-only batch login** — Added `nlm login batch <accounts.txt>` to authenticate many Google accounts interactively from a text file containing one email per line. Profiles are named numerically, continuing after the highest existing numeric profile by default (`1`, `2`, `3`, ...), Google sign-in is opened with an email hint, and passwords are never read, stored, or typed by the CLI.
- **Batch login email autofill** — When Google's `login_hint` parameter is ignored, the CLI now fills the visible `identifierId` / `identifier` email field via CDP trusted text input, resolves the active Google Accounts tab if needed, and clicks Next, while still leaving password entry manual.
- **All-profiles login refresh** — Added `nlm login --all-profiles` / `nlm login --all` to refresh authentication for every saved profile in sequence using each profile's isolated browser session, with the same 10-second post-login close delay. Use `--start-index <n>` to begin from a specific numeric profile. Closing the auth browser before login completes now skips that profile and continues to the next one.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Login timeout after Google sign-in (#174)** — `is_logged_in()` used substring matching on the full URL, so the post-sign-in redirect URL containing `original_referer=...accounts.google.com...` in the query string was misidentified as a sign-in page. Now parses the URL hostname via `urlparse()`. Thanks to **@SKMKZP** for the clear root cause analysis and fix!
- **Headless browser hijacking during `nlm login`** — `find_any_existing_cdp_browser()` would blindly reuse any Chrome with CDP enabled on ports 9222-9231, including headless instances from other tools (e.g. Perplexity MCP). This caused `nlm login` to silently hang for 5 minutes waiting for sign-in on an invisible browser. Now checks User-Agent for `HeadlessChrome` and skips automation browsers.
- **Silent login wait loop** — When waiting for user sign-in, the CLI now emits status messages instead of hanging silently for up to 5 minutes with no feedback.

### Changed

- Extracted `_fetch_cdp_version()` helper to share `/json/version` logic between `get_debugger_url()` and `find_any_existing_cdp_browser()`.

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Source Label Management** — Organize notebook sources into thematic categories with the new `label` MCP tool and `nlm label` CLI commands. Full action set: `auto` (AI-generated labels), `list`, `create`, `rename`, `set_emoji`, `move_source`, and `delete`. Multi-label assignment supported — sources can belong to more than one label. Requires 5+ sources for auto-labeling.

### Fixed

- **WSL Firewall check encoding (#172)** — PowerShell on Windows commonly returns output in UTF-16-LE, causing a `UnicodeDecodeError` in `check_firewall_rule()` that made `nlm login --wsl` show a false firewall warning even when the rule already existed. Fixed by adding `errors="replace"` to the subprocess call. Thanks to **@andrepreira** for the diagnosis and clean fix!

---

## [0.5.31] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **EOF on Initialization (Issue #171)** — The MCP `stdio` transport strictly requires `stdout` to be used *only* for JSON-RPC messages. `fastmcp` initialization logs (and any other stray `print()` calls) were corrupting the `stdout` stream, causing MCP clients to crash with an EOF error on Windows and macOS. Added a dedicated `_StdoutToStderrWrapper` in `server.py` that intercepts all standard text output and safely redirects it to `stderr`, while preserving the underlying binary `.buffer` for valid JSON-RPC payloads. Thanks to **@swiezaczek** for the thorough analysis in the issue report!

## [0.5.30] - 2026-04-25
### Fixed
- **Auth loop when `NOTEBOOKLM_COOKIES` env var is stale (Issue #170)** — `refresh_auth` now detects when `NOTEBOOKLM_COOKIES` is set in the environment and returns a clear, actionable error instead of falsely reporting "success" while silently reloading the same stale cookies. Auth failure messages now include a note pointing to the env var when it's the likely cause. Thanks to **@nobolso** for the thorough root cause analysis!
- **Deprecated `NOTEBOOKLM_CSRF_TOKEN` / `NOTEBOOKLM_SESSION_ID` env vars removed** — These were still being read and passed to the client constructor, which caused them to bypass auto-refresh when stale. Both are now always auto-extracted; the deprecated env vars are ignored.

### Documentation
- Added troubleshooting section to `AUTHENTICATION.md` explaining the `NOTEBOOKLM_COOKIES` env var override trap, how to diagnose it, and both fix options.

## [0.5.29] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Python 3.11 TypedDict compatibility (Issue #167)** — Pydantic v2 rejects `typing.TypedDict` on Python < 3.12. All 13 service files now import `TypedDict` from a centralized compat shim (`services/_compat.py`) that uses `typing_extensions` on < 3.12. Added `typing_extensions` as an explicit dependency for Python < 3.12. Thanks to **@irvinghu07** for the clear report and suggested fixes!
- **SOCKS proxy blocks `nlm login` (Issue #167)** — The CDP helper's `httpx.Client` inherited `ALL_PROXY` from the environment, causing `ImportError: socksio not installed` on localhost CDP connections. Fixed with `trust_env=False`. Thanks to **@irvinghu07**!
- **MCP `notebook_list` always returns "Authentication expired" (Issue #169)** — `save_tokens_to_cache()` only wrote to the legacy `auth.json`, but `load_cached_tokens()` prioritizes `profiles/default/cookies.json`. Tokens saved via the MCP `save_auth_tokens` tool were never read back. Fixed by syncing writes to both `auth.json` and the active profile. Thanks to **@nobolso** for the thorough diagnosis and file structure analysis!
- **Python 3.14 Windows `pathlib.mkdir` regression (Issue #169)** — `Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` raises `FileExistsError` (WinError 183) on Python 3.14 + Windows. Added `safe_mkdir()` wrapper applied to all `mkdir` calls across `config.py`, `auth.py`, `base.py`, and `cdp.py`. Thanks to **@nobolso**!

## [0.5.28] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **HTTP transport: default to stateless mode (Issue #165)** — HTTP transport (`--transport http`) now defaults to stateless sessions, preventing the MCP SDK double-response crash (`AssertionError: Request already responded to`) that killed entire sessions on slow Google API calls. Use `--no-stateless` to opt out. Thanks to **@mylaser215** for the thorough root cause analysis (#165)!

### Changed
- **CLI flags use `BooleanOptionalAction`** — `--stateless` / `--no-stateless` and `--debug` / `--no-debug` are now proper toggle pairs. Environment variables (`NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_STATELESS`, `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_DEBUG`) accept `true/false/0/1/yes/no/on/off` (case-insensitive).

### Documentation
- **CLI Guide: document all skill install targets (Issue #163)** — Added `agents`, `codex`, `gemini-cli`, and `alef-agent` with install path details. Fixed missing `opencode` in setup clients list.

## [0.5.27] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Restore skill targets for codex and gemini-cli (Issue #163)** — Restored the missing target configurations for `codex` and `gemini-cli` agent skills and added Alef Agent specific frontmatter logic. Thanks to the user who reported this issue (#163)!

### Fixed
- **Source: Honour `--title` when adding a file source (PR #162)** — Fixed an issue where adding a file source via CLI ignored the user's custom title. The source upload is now fully awaited before the follow-up rename is fired to guarantee precision. Huge thanks to **@CryptoWombat** for this excellent contribution and thorough fix!

## [0.5.26] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **`server_info` reports local auth state (Issue #160)** — Response includes `auth_status` (`configured` | `stale` | `not_configured` | `error`) based on cached token presence and age. This is a local disk check only, not a live Google validation; docstring clarifies. Thanks to **@josuebustosn** for the report and expected behavior.

### Fixed
- **Windows Unicode: all CLI Rich consoles use safe factory (Issue #156)** — Every CLI command module and the default `Formatter` now use `make_console()` (`safe_box`, `legacy_windows=False` on Windows) instead of bare `Console()`. Complements the UTF-8 stdio bootstrap from v0.5.25 and avoids `UnicodeEncodeError` / MCP EOF on legacy Windows code pages when printing API text with arrows, smart quotes, etc. Thanks again to **@argonaut-cm** for the original EOF / Unicode analysis (v0.5.25 thanked the stdio + Rich bootstrap; this completes CLI-wide coverage).
- **MCP reloads client after `nlm login` without manual `refresh_auth` (Issue #161)** — `get_client()` now invalidates the singleton when on-disk tokens are newer than the running client (`extracted_at` vs `_created_at`), not only when the cookie dict changes. Same-profile re-auth updates are picked up automatically. Auth expiry error message mentions `refresh_auth` as a fallback. Thanks to **@josuebustosn** for the clear repro and suggested directions.

## [0.5.25] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Audio download fails with 302→404 (Issue #158)** — Google's audio media list contains multiple URL variants: `=m140-dv` (download variant, fast CDN via `drum.usercontent.google.com`, ~3 MB/s) and `=m140` (streaming transcode via `googlevideo.com`, ~30 KB/s). The download logic now explicitly prefers the `-dv` variant for both `download_audio` and `_extract_audio_media_url`. Audio downloads that previously failed now complete a 47MB file in ~15 seconds. Thanks to **@Victor777777** for the detailed bug report and redirect chain analysis!
- **CDP WebSocket broken with system proxy (Issue #119, PR #157)** — When `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables are set (e.g., Clash, Surge), `websocket-client` routed localhost CDP connections through the external proxy, crashing `nlm login`. Fixed by temporarily clearing proxy env vars around `websocket.create_connection` in `execute_cdp_command`. The existing httpx fix (#119) only covered HTTP; this completes the WebSocket side. Thanks to **@ahmelkholy** for identifying the issue and contributing PR #157!
- **Windows: MCP server crashes with UnicodeEncodeError (Issue #156)** — On Windows consoles using cp1252 encoding, Rich's legacy renderer crashed on Unicode characters like `→` (U+2192) returned by NotebookLM, killing the MCP server process and causing client EOF disconnects. Fixed by reconfiguring `stdout`/`stderr` to UTF-8 with replacement at process startup (both CLI and MCP entry points) and setting `legacy_windows=False` on Rich Console instances. Thanks to **@argonaut-cm** for the clear traceback and proposed solutions!

### Changed
- **Lazy-load `NotebookLMClient` in package `__init__`** — `from notebooklm_tools import NotebookLMClient` now uses `__getattr__` to defer the heavy import until first access, keeping the stdio encoding bootstrap lightweight.

## [0.5.24] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Studio: Surface revise RPC errors with actionable hints (PR #154)** — When `slides revise` fails due to an invalid artifact ID or a rejected revision request, the error now surfaces the specific Google API error code (e.g., `INVALID_ARGUMENT`) along with a clear hint guiding the user to verify their artifact ID. Previously, these failures produced opaque, unhelpful error messages. Thank you **@sickn33** for this fix!
- **WSL2: Auth broken on Chrome 136+ due to localhost-only CDP (PR #155)** — Chrome 136+ ignores `--remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0`, restricting the DevTools Protocol to `127.0.0.1` only. This completely broke `nlm login --wsl` for all WSL2 users. The fix switches to a port proxy approach: Chrome launches on port 9223 (localhost) and WSL connects via port 9222 through a `netsh interface portproxy` rule. Temp Chrome profiles are now created on the Windows filesystem (`%TEMP%`) instead of WSL's `/tmp` to prevent "Profile error occurred" crashes. Updated `docs/WSL_SETUP.md` with one-time setup instructions. Thank you **@casjogreen** for this critical fix!

## [0.5.23] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Restore NotebookLM MCP and CLI runtime contracts (PR #152)** — Fixed MCP tool boundary registration, normalized error payloads, and restored download/upload sync-compatible entrypoints. Thank you **@sickn33** for this immense contribution!

### Fixed
- **Windows: Server crashes immediately on startup (Issue #150)** — `os.execvp` fails on Windows. Replaced with `subprocess.run` to prevent immediate crashes on Windows 11 during server startup via the `.mcpb` bundle. Added explicit `stdin=sys.stdin`, `stdout=sys.stdout`, and `stderr=sys.stderr` to ensure the JSON-RPC stdio channel between Claude Desktop and the server remains properly connected across platforms. Thanks to **@m3saros** for diagnosing the root cause and providing the exact fix!

## [0.5.22] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Studio status code parity and normalization (PR #149)** — Consolidated the extraction logic for studio artifacts into a centralized `_normalize_studio_status` routine. The `JsonFormatter` has been updated to dynamically populate returned JSON payloads with newly available artifact fields (such as `audio_url`, `video_url`, `slide_deck_url`, `flashcard_count`) without breaking the shape expected by downstream consumers. Huge thanks to **@sickn33** for this amazing contribution!

### Fixed
- **API `poll_studio_status` bypassing auth recovery** — The core `poll_studio_status` helper function was making raw HTTP calls and dodging the standard `_call_rpc` pipeline. This caused it to immediately fail on `400 Bad Request` exceptions whenever the user's `build_label` or session tokens went stale. The polling function now correctly wraps its logic in `_call_rpc`, securing free auth recovery loops, retries, and unified debug capability during studio polling.

## [0.5.21] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **HTTP 400 bad request causing silent auth failures (Issue #147)** — Google returns `400 Bad Request` instead of `401` or `403` when the internal CSRF token expires. Added 400 to the retryable auth status codes, which fixes auth recovery failures and prevents tracebacks (PR #148).
- **WSL CDP failures breaking auth (Issue #138, #144)** — Native WSL connectivity has been fully added. `nlm login --wsl` securely launches and channels DevTools via `0.0.0.0` to safely bridge the WSL network boundary.
- **Pass Build Label in login check** — The `nlm login --check` command was initiating a client without passing the configured build label, unnecessarily triggering a three-month backward fallback.

## [0.5.20] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **`nlm create infographic` crash when `--style` not specified (Issue #142)** — The verb-first route was missing the `--style` option entirely, causing a `TypeError` on invocation. Fixed alongside 12 other missing parameters across verb-first wrappers.
- **Multiple verb-first commands missing parameters** — The verb-first CLI route (`nlm create`, `nlm add`, `nlm describe`, `nlm query`, `nlm delete`) was missing 13 parameters that existed on the noun-first route: `--focus` on `nlm create quiz` and `nlm create flashcards`; `--wait` and `--wait-timeout` on `nlm add url`, `nlm add text`, and `nlm add drive`; `--auto-import` on `nlm research start`; `--format` on `nlm download slides`; `--json` on `nlm describe notebook`, `nlm query notebook`, and `nlm source content`; and `--confirm` on `nlm delete alias`.

### Changed
- **Widened `fastmcp` dependency to `>=2.0.0,<4.0` (Issue #141)** — The previous upper bound (`<3.0`) caused a startup crash when `fakeredis 2.35.0` was installed alongside `fastmcp 2.x`. Widening to `<4.0` resolves the incompatibility and allows users to use newer FastMCP releases without version conflicts.

### Added
- **Parameter parity test (`tests/cli/test_verbs_parity.py`)** — Automatically compares every verb-first wrapper in `cli/commands/verbs.py` against its target function to detect missing parameters. CI will now fail if a verb wrapper drifts out of sync with its noun-first counterpart.

## [0.5.19] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Auto-Import for Research** — Added `--auto-import` / `--wait-and-import` flags to `nlm research start` to automatically wait for research to finish and immediately import.

### Fixed
- **Deep Research Task ID Mismatch (Issue #140)** — Fixed a bug where deep research task IDs were being mutated by the backend and causing import failures. The CLI now polls the correct mutated task ID before issuing the import command.
- **Empty Notebook Error Mapping** — When attempting to query a notebook with 0 sources, the backend previously threw an unhelpful `API error (code 5): unknown`. This now returns a clean validation error indicating the notebook is empty and needs sources added.
- **gRPC Error Code Mapping** — Generic undocumented gRPC error codes from Google's batchexecute API (like 5, 7, 16) are now mapped to their standard names (`NOT_FOUND`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`, etc.) instead of logging as `unknown`.

## [0.5.18] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **WSL2 Authentication Support (PR #138)** — New `nlm login --wsl` flag launches Windows Chrome from WSL2 for seamless authentication. Includes automatic firewall rule management, cross-boundary CDP communication, and a cleanup mechanism for temporary Chrome profiles. Full setup guide at `docs/WSL_SETUP.md`. Thanks to **@kylebrodeur** for the comprehensive implementation!
- **WSL2 Diagnostics** — `nlm doctor` now detects WSL2 environments and reports Chrome availability, Windows interop status, and firewall configuration.

### Fixed
- **Thread-Safety for Concurrent MCP Tool Calls (PR #135)** — Added `threading.Lock` to `BaseClient` protecting mutable state (`_reqid_counter`, `_conversation_cache`, `_source_rpc_version`) from race conditions during parallel MCP tool invocations. Uses double-checked locking for singleton client initialization. Includes 7 new concurrent access tests. Thanks to **@xiangyuwang1998** for the implementation!
- **Restored CDP WebSocket Timeout** — Re-applied the 30-second timeout on `execute_cdp_command()` that was inadvertently removed during the WSL2 merge. Prevents infinite hangs on stale/dropped WebSocket connections.
- **Restored Port Map File Permissions** — Re-applied `chmod 0o600` on the port map file that was inadvertently removed during the WSL2 merge. Ensures the port map is only readable by the owner.

## [0.5.17] - 2026-04-07

### Security
- **CDP Origin Restriction (PR #133)** — Chrome is now launched with `--remote-allow-origins` restricted to `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` only, preventing malicious webpages from connecting to the CDP debug port. Previously allowed all origins (`*`). Thanks to **@wccheung11011001** for the security audit!
- **Base URL Allowlist (PR #133)** — The `NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL` environment variable is now validated against an allowlist of known Google domains (HTTPS only), preventing cookie exfiltration via environment injection.
- **Download Path Traversal Protection (PR #133)** — Added `validate_output_path()` to block downloads from writing to sensitive directories (`.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.kube`, `.claude`, `.config`) or overwriting sensitive files (`authorized_keys`, `id_rsa`, `.bashrc`, etc.).
- **File Permission Hardening (PR #133)** — Auth-related files, debug output, and the port map are now created with restrictive permissions (`0o600` for files, `0o700` for the storage directory). Thanks to **@wccheung11011001**!
- **CDP WebSocket Timeout (PR #133)** — Added a 30-second timeout to CDP WebSocket commands to prevent infinite blocking on stale or dropped connections.

### Added
- **Custom Visual Style Prompts for Video (PR #131)** — You can now pass a custom style description when creating videos with `--style custom --style-prompt "your description"` (CLI) or `video_style_prompt` (MCP). The style prompt is also returned in studio status responses. Thanks to **@agarwalvipin** for the implementation and live API verification!
- **Audio Source Support (PR #134)** — `nlm source add --file` now correctly handles audio uploads (m4a, wav, mp3). Audio sources use type code 10, which was previously unrecognized. The `--wait` flag now handles audio's transient status 3 state (which is not a hard failure for audio, unlike other source types) and a new `--wait-timeout` flag (default 600s) gives long recordings enough time to finish transcribing. Thanks to **@stanleykao72** for the thorough investigation and fix!
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Added a contributor guide covering architecture rules, the Chrome DevTools API capture workflow, testing requirements (both CLI and MCP), security guidelines, error handling patterns, and PR expectations.

### Fixed
- **`build_label` Data Loss (PR #133)** — `Profile.to_dict()` was silently dropping the `build_label` field, causing it to be lost across restarts and re-fetched from scratch. Now properly persisted. Thanks to **@wccheung11011001**!
- **Ruff Lint and Format Violations** — Fixed `B904` exception chaining in CDP timeout handler, and resolved format violations in `sources.py`, `config.py`, `test_url_source_fallback.py`, and `test_studio.py`.

## [0.5.16] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **URL Source Addition Failing with INVALID_ARGUMENT (Issue #121)** — Fixed `source_add` (URL type) failing with `RPC error code 3 (INVALID_ARGUMENT)` for some users due to Google migrating the `add_source` endpoint. Implemented a dual-RPC fallback: the system tries the legacy `izAoDd` endpoint first, and if it returns code 3, automatically retries with the new `ozz5Z` endpoint. The working endpoint is cached per session to avoid extra round-trips on subsequent calls. Both single and bulk URL additions (`url` and `urls` parameters) benefit from the fallback. Thanks to **@Neophen** for reporting!

### Added
- **19 new unit tests** for dual RPC fallback mechanism (total: 704 tests)

## [0.5.15] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Async Query Polling (Issue #125)** — New `notebook_query_start` and `notebook_query_status` MCP tools for querying large notebooks (50+ sources) without hitting MCP client timeouts. `notebook_query_start` fires the query in a background thread and returns immediately with a `query_id`. Poll `notebook_query_status` with the `query_id` to get the result when ready. Includes automatic TTL cleanup (10 min) for stale entries. The existing `notebook_query` tool remains unchanged for backward compatibility.
- **10 new unit tests** for async query lifecycle (total: 685 tests)

## [0.5.14] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Research Start Dead Parameter (Issue #123)** — Fixed a bug where `nlm research start "query" --title "My Title"` (and the corresponding MCP tool parameter `title`) failed because the internal logic did not automatically trigger new notebook creation when `title` was provided without a `notebook_id`.

## [0.5.13] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Python 3.13 Crash in `nlm skill` (Issue #122)** — Fixed a crash when running `nlm skill install` on Python 3.13, which was caused by using `@click.option(type=Literal["user", "project"])`. Replaced with standard string validation. Thanks to **@zhaoguoqiao** for reporting!
- **CDP Proxy Bypass (Issue #119)** — The `httpx` HTTP2 client was honoring system proxy settings even for the internal `127.0.0.1` CDP WebSocket acquisition call (`http://127.0.0.1:9222/json`). This caused connections to fail on machines running proxies. Restored the `proxy=None` argument to explicitly bypass proxies for local loopback connections. Thanks to **@sjs33** for discovering and reporting this!
- **`research_status` Polling Loop (PR #120)** — Restored the internal polling loop for `research_status` when `max_wait` is set. Previously, the parameters were ignored after a refactor, and it always returned after a single check. The tool now correctly blocks and polls until the research is completed or times out. Thanks to **@byingyang** for the excellent bug report, full implementation, and test suite!

## [0.5.12] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **Auth recovery skips profile-based cookies (Issue #117, Bug 1)** — `_try_reload_or_headless_auth()` gated Layer 2 recovery on `auth.json` existence. If the legacy file didn't exist, valid profile-based credentials in `profiles/default/cookies.json` were completely skipped, falling straight through to headless auth (Layer 3). Now always calls `load_cached_tokens()` which checks the profile directory first, then falls back to `auth.json`. Thanks to **@olaservo** for the incredibly detailed report!
- **`--cdp-url` ignored by builtin provider (Issue #117, Bug 2)** — `nlm login --cdp-url http://127.0.0.1:9222` was ignored when using the default builtin provider, always launching a new Chrome instead. Now, when `--cdp-url` is explicitly provided (even with the builtin provider), the CLI auto-routes to the existing-CDP extraction path, matching the user's intent to connect to an already-running browser. Thanks again to **@olaservo**!
- **Pre-existing lint errors blocking CI** — Fixed 3 lint violations (`SIM105` in `auth.py`, `I001` in `base.py`, `F401` in `test_coerce_list.py`) that were blocking the CI pipeline for PR #118.

### Security
- **Restrict `auth.json` file permissions (PR #116)** — Auth token cache files are now written with `chmod 600` (owner read/write only), preventing other local users or processes from reading active session cookies. Thanks to **@tody-agent** for the security audit!

## [0.5.11] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Enterprise / Google Workspace support (PR #114)** — Configurable base URL via `NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL` environment variable. Set to `https://notebooklm.cloud.google.com` (or your organization's URL) to use NotebookLM with managed Workspace accounts. All API calls, authentication, file uploads, and URL detection are updated to use the configured base URL. Default remains `https://notebooklm.google.com` for personal accounts (fully backward compatible). Thanks to **@Robiton** for this contribution!

### Documentation
- Added "Enterprise / Google Workspace" section to `docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`
- Added `NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL` to environment variables table in `docs/MCP_GUIDE.md`

## [0.5.10] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Quiz/Flashcard `focus_prompt` ignored (Issue #113)** — The `focus_prompt` parameter for quiz and flashcard generation was silently ignored due to an off-by-one error in the RPC payload structure. The backend expects `focus_prompt` at array index `[2]` (after a reserved `null` slot), but it was being placed at index `[1]`. Both `create_quiz` and `create_flashcards` in `core/studio.py` now use the correct payload layout. Thanks to **@ojsed** for the detailed analysis!
- **`source_ids` parameter fails with string input (Issue #111)** — MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) frequently serialize list parameters as JSON strings (`'["a","b"]'`) or comma-separated strings (`'a,b'`) instead of native Python lists, causing Pydantic validation errors. Added a `coerce_list()` helper in `mcp/tools/_utils.py` that normalizes all input forms (JSON strings, comma-separated, single values, native lists) into proper `list[T]`. Applied to all 6 list parameters across 4 MCP tool files: `studio_create`, `notebook_query`, `source_add`, `source_sync_drive`, `source_delete`, and `research_import`. Thanks to **@Carlos-OL** for reporting!
- **Non-ASCII characters in JSON output (PR #112)** — Fixed `ensure_ascii=False` missing from `json.dumps()` calls across core and CLI layers, causing Unicode characters to be escaped as `\uXXXX` in RPC request bodies and file persistence. Thanks to **@rujinlong** for the fix!

### Added
- **13 new unit tests** for `coerce_list` helper (total: 660 tests)

## [0.5.9] - 2026-03-25
### Fixed
- Fixed a fatal `ImportError` in the CLI (`ArtifactNotReadyError`) caused by missed codebase updates during the v0.5.8 structural refactor.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed/Changed
- Codebase-wide refactor to comply with comprehensive `ruff` linting and formatting standards.
- Fixed broken imports caused by code structure refactoring.
- A massive thank you to **@nikosavola** for submitting BOTH the `ruff` linting and formatting refactor (PR #110) AND the GitHub Actions CI Pipeline (PR #109)! These are huge improvements to the codebase quality.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **GitHub Actions CI Pipeline (PR #109)** — Added a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs linting (`ruff format --check`, `ruff check`) and the full pytest suite (`uv run pytest`) on pull requests and pushes to `main`. Linting errors now block the build, guaranteeing code quality before merge. Thanks to **@nikosavola** for this contribution!

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Windows: manual cookies rejected after import (Issue #105)** — `nlm login --manual --file` saved cookies correctly, but subsequent requests to `notebooklm.google.com` were rejected by Google (302 → login page) because the page-fetch headers included macOS-specific Client Hints (`sec-ch-ua-platform: "macOS"`, `sec-ch-ua`, `sec-ch-ua-mobile`). When cookies were captured from a Windows Chrome session, the OS fingerprint mismatch caused Google to reject the session. Removed all three `sec-ch-ua*` headers (they're optional per spec) and switched to a platform-neutral Linux Chrome UA — making auth platform-agnostic. Also added a multi-pattern CSRF token fallback (`SNlM0e` → `at=` → `FdrFJe`) in `_refresh_auth_tokens`, and a `make_console(safe_box=True)` factory to prevent `UnicodeEncodeError` crashes on Windows `cp1251`/`cp1252` codepage terminals. Thanks to **@pakulyaev** for the detailed diagnosis and debug output! (5 new regression tests added)
- **Windows: IPv6 WebSocket connection error during `nlm login` (Issue #108)** — On Windows, Chrome's DevTools debugger binds to `127.0.0.1` (IPv4), but `websocket-client` resolves `localhost` to `::1` (IPv6), causing `PermissionError: [WinError 10013]`. Added a `_normalize_ws_url()` helper that explicitly rewrites `ws://localhost:` to `ws://127.0.0.1:` at all 4 WebSocket connection sites in `cdp.py`. Thanks to **@theteleporter** for the spot-on diagnosis!

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-23


### Fixed
- **MCP `download_artifact` failing for report/mind_map/data_table (Issue #107)** — The MCP `download_artifact` tool exclusively routed through `download_async()`, but `_dispatch_async()` had no handlers for `report`, `mind_map`, or `data_table` (only `_dispatch_sync()` did). Added these three non-streaming types to the async dispatcher so all artifact types are downloadable via the MCP tool. Thanks to **@Neophen** for the detailed bug report!
- **`poll_research` returning `None` for deep research in multi-task notebooks (Issue #106)** — When deep research mutates the task ID internally and the notebook has multiple research tasks, `poll_research` returned `None` instead of a valid task. The fallback now prefers any `in_progress` task, then falls back to the most recent task. Thanks to **@Neophen** for reporting!

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Verb-style `nlm delete source` TypeError (Issue #104)** — `nlm delete source <id> --confirm` was crashing with `TypeError: delete_source() got an unexpected keyword argument 'source_id'`. The verb-style CLI layer in `verbs.py` was passing `source_id=source` (singular string) but the underlying function expects `source_ids` (a list). Fixed the parameter name and wrapped the value in a list. The noun-style `nlm source delete` was unaffected. Thanks to **@Le-Yann** for the detailed bug report and root cause analysis!

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-22

### Improved
- **Actionable Error Hints Across CLI & MCP (Issue #103)** — All CLI commands and MCP tools now provide structured, user-friendly error messages with actionable hints (e.g., "Run 'nlm login' to authenticate" or "Run 'nlm notebook list' to see available notebooks"). Thanks to **@ahnbu** for suggesting this improvement!
  - **CLI**: Consolidated error handling via centralized `handle_error()` across all 13 command modules. Errors with `--json` flag now output structured JSON (`{"status": "error", "error": "...", "hint": "..."}`).
  - **MCP**: All 27 MCP tools now include `hint` fields in error responses for AI agent consumption.
  - **Services**: `ServiceError` now carries an optional `hint` attribute, propagated from `NLMError` exceptions.
  - **Core**: `NotebookLMError` (parent of `RPCError`, `ArtifactError`, etc.) now inherits from `NLMError`, ensuring all low-level API errors are caught and handled gracefully instead of producing raw tracebacks.

### Fixed
- **Non-ASCII characters in JSON output (PR #100)** — CLI JSON output (`--json` flag) now preserves Unicode characters (e.g., `café`, `こんにちは`) instead of escaping them as `\uXXXX` sequences via a shared `print_json()` helper with `ensure_ascii=False`. Thanks to **@nickyfoto** for the contribution. (PR #100)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Deep Research Transient Errors (Issue #98)** — Deep research (`--mode deep`) no longer silently fails with a generic "no confirmation from API" message when Google returns a transient error. The structured error payload (e.g., `DeepResearchErrorDetail` code 3) is now properly detected and surfaced with an actionable message: *"Google API error code 3 (DeepResearchErrorDetail). This is likely a transient issue. Try again in a few minutes, or use --mode fast."*
- **Research RPC Infrastructure** — Refactored `start_research()` to use the standard `_call_rpc()` pipeline instead of raw HTTP calls. This gives deep and fast research automatic auth retry, server error retries, and enhanced debug logging for free.

### Added
- **`RPCError` exception class** — New structured error type in `core/errors.py` for Google batchexecute errors with error code, detail type, and detail data attributes. All non-auth RPC errors (not just code 16) are now properly raised.
- **6 new unit tests** (3 core-level, 3 service-level) for RPCError detection and user-friendly error messages (total: 634 tests)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Research Import Timeout (Issue #97)** — `research import` now uses a 300-second default timeout (up from 120s), fixing consistent timeouts on notebooks with many sources. The timeout is configurable via `--timeout` / `-t` in CLI and `timeout` parameter in MCP.
- **Research Start Deadlock (Issue #97)** — `research start` no longer hard-exits when previous research has un-imported sources. Instead, it shows a warning and prompts interactively, so users can choose to proceed or import first. Previously, if import timed out, users were stuck — unable to import or start new research without `--force`.

### Added
- **Configurable Import Timeout** — `nlm research import <notebook> <task-id> --timeout 600` for extra-large notebooks. Available in both CLI (`--timeout` / `-t`) and MCP (`timeout` parameter on `research_import`). Default: 300 seconds.
- **2 new unit tests** for timeout parameter forwarding (total: 624 tests)

## [0.4.9] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **CC-Claw Skill Support** — Added `cc-claw` as a supported tool for `nlm skill install cc-claw` (`~/.cc-claw/workspace/skills/nlm-skill/`).

### Fixed
- **Windows CLI Argument Parsing (Issue #96)** — Fixed a bug where running `nlm add url <notebook_id> "https://..."` on Windows PowerShell incorrectly parsed the URL string into a list of characters, attempting to add dozens of duplicate sources instead of one.
- **Service Layer Robustness** — Added internal safeguards ensuring single string URL parsing never falls through to character unpacking across the API service boundary.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Native Chat History Persistence** — Both the CLI (`nlm notebook query`) and the MCP server now perfectly persist their chat history directly into the NotebookLM web UI. All prompts sent via CLI or MCP agents will now appear in the notebook's native chat panel, sharing the same conversational context as the web UI. (Closes #92)
- **OpenCode Support** — Full support for OpenCode in the `nlm setup` command (`nlm setup add opencode`) to automatically configure the NotebookLM MCP server for OpenCode. Includes smart config array injection and parsing. Thanks to **@woohyun212** for the comprehensive implementation and thorough unit tests (PR #95, closes #95).

### Fixed
- **MCP Profile Switching** — Fixed a bug where the MCP server wouldn't respect dynamic authentication profile changes made via `nlm login switch <profile>`. The server now automatically detects token file changes and gracefully reloads the NotebookLM client in real-time, matching the active profile perfectly.
- **CC-Claw Skill Support** — Added `cc-claw` as a supported tool for `nlm skill install cc-claw` (`~/.cc-claw/workspace/skills/nlm-skill/`).
## [0.4.7] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **Skill path migration: `.gemini/skills/` → `.agents/skills/`** — Starting with Gemini CLI v0.33.1, `.agents/skills/` is the recommended cross-tool compatible path (higher priority than `.gemini/skills/`). `nlm skill install gemini-cli` and `nlm skill install codex` are replaced by `nlm skill install agents`, which installs to `~/.agents/skills/nlm-skill/`. This path works for Gemini CLI, Codex, and any tool that reads `.agents/skills/`. Users with existing `gemini-cli` or `codex` installations should run `nlm skill install agents` to reinstall at the new location.
- **Documentation updates** — Added v0.4.6 features (batch, cross-notebook, pipelines, tags) to SKILL.md, AGENTS_SECTION.md, and API_REFERENCE.md. Removed stale QUICK_REFERENCE.md.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Batch Operations** — Perform actions across multiple notebooks at once. Thanks to **@fabianafurtadoff** for this contribution (PR #90)!
  - `nlm batch query` — Query multiple notebooks with the same question
  - `nlm batch add-source` — Add a URL to multiple notebooks
  - `nlm batch create` — Create multiple notebooks at once
  - `nlm batch delete` — Delete multiple notebooks (requires `--confirm`)
  - `nlm batch studio` — Generate artifacts across multiple notebooks
  - MCP: Consolidated `batch` tool with `action` parameter (query|add_source|create|delete|studio)
- **Cross-Notebook Query** — Query multiple notebooks and get aggregated answers with per-notebook citations. (PR #90, @fabianafurtadoff)
  - `nlm cross query "question" --notebooks "id1,id2"` — Ask across specific notebooks
  - `nlm cross query "question" --tags "ai,research"` — Query by tag
  - MCP: `cross_notebook_query` tool
- **Pipelines** — Define and execute multi-step notebook workflows. (PR #90, @fabianafurtadoff)
  - `nlm pipeline list` — List available pipelines (3 builtin: ingest-and-podcast, research-and-report, multi-format)
  - `nlm pipeline run <notebook> <pipeline-name>` — Execute a pipeline
  - User-defined pipelines via YAML files in `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/pipelines/`
  - MCP: Consolidated `pipeline` tool with `action` parameter (run|list)
- **Smart Select & Tagging** — Tag notebooks and find relevant ones by keyword matching. (PR #90, @fabianafurtadoff)
  - `nlm tag add <notebook> --tags "ai,research"` — Add tags
  - `nlm tag remove <notebook> --tags "ai"` — Remove tags
  - `nlm tag list` — List all tagged notebooks
  - `nlm tag select "query"` — Find notebooks by tag match
  - MCP: Consolidated `tag` tool with `action` parameter (add|remove|list|select)
- **Studio List Types** — Reference of all artifact types and their options, accessible via `studio_status(action="list_types")`
- **73 new unit tests** covering all new service modules (total: 576 tests)

### Changed
- **MCP Tool Consolidation** — Reduced 13 new tools to 4 consolidated tools with action parameters, keeping total MCP tools at 35 (down from what would have been 44). Follows existing patterns (`note`, `source_add`).

### Fixed
- **CLI import violations** — Fixed 3 CLI command files (`batch.py`, `cross.py`, `pipeline.py`) importing `get_client` from `mcp/tools/_utils` instead of `cli/utils`, violating architecture layering
- **Missing UTF-8 encoding** — Added `encoding='utf-8'` to 6 file I/O calls in `smart_select.py` and `pipeline.py` to prevent `UnicodeDecodeError` on Windows
- **Cross-notebook display crash** — Fixed `sources_used` field handling in `cross.py` display formatting (could crash on string values)

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **`nlm doctor` crash on Windows (Issue #87)** — Fixed `UnicodeDecodeError` when running `claude mcp list` on Windows systems with non-UTF-8 default encodings (e.g., `cp936`, `cp1252`). Added explicit `encoding="utf-8"` and `errors="replace"` to the subprocess call. Also added a null check for `result.stdout` to prevent `AttributeError` when the subprocess returns no output.
- **Silent Chrome launch failures on Windows (Issue #86)** — `launch_chrome_process` was silently swallowing all `subprocess.Popen` exceptions, causing `nlm login` to report the cryptic "Cannot connect to browser on port XXXX" with no indication of what went wrong. Now logs the browser path, port, and exception details so users get actionable error messages. Added debug logging for successful launches as well.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Complex citation parsing (PR #84)** — Fixed `notebook_query` dropping cited text when Google returns "direct" citation segments (integer-first elements) alongside the standard "wrapped" format. Both segment variants are now correctly handled. Thanks to **@meirtsvi** for this contribution!
- **Table citation extraction (PR #84)** — When a citation references a data table, the response now includes a structured `cited_table` field with `num_columns` and `rows` data. Table segments are indicated by a `<cited_table>` placeholder in the `cited_text` field.
- **Mind map JSON missing from MCP response (Issue #83)** — `studio_create` for mind maps was returning metadata (`root_name`, `children_count`) but dropping the actual `mind_map_json`. The full JSON now flows through to MCP clients. Thanks to **@cowhi** for reporting!

### Added
- **17 new unit tests** for citation parsing — Comprehensive test coverage for direct/wrapped segment detection, table placeholder insertion, `_extract_text_from_table_rows`, `_extract_table_from_detail`, and `cited_table` in `_extract_citation_data`. Total tests: 503.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-08

### Removed
- **`nlm setup add claude-desktop` removed** — Claude Desktop users should install via the `.mcpb` extension (download from [Releases](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli/releases/latest), double-click to install). The CLI-based config file editing was unreliable compared to the extension approach. `nlm setup add claude-code` (for the Claude Code CLI) is unchanged.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Expanded file format support (PR #82)** — File uploads now accept additional formats. Thanks to **@JumpLao** for this contribution!
  - Audio: `.m4a`, `.wav`, `.aac`, `.ogg`, `.opus` (previously only `.mp3`)
  - Images: `.gif`, `.webp` (previously only `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`)
  - Note: `.flac`, `.webm`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv` were removed from the original PR as Google's upload server does not accept them
- **Cited text passages in query output (PR #81)** — `notebook_query` responses now include a `references` array with the actual quoted passage text for each citation. Previously, only the source ID and citation number were returned; the passage text was already in the API response but was being discarded. Thanks to **@cbruyndoncx** for this contribution!
  - Each reference includes `source_id`, `citation_number`, and `cited_text`
  - Backward-compatible: existing `sources_used` and `citations` fields unchanged
  - Flows through MCP and CLI automatically
- **`nlm setup add all` — Interactive multi-tool setup** — Scans the system for installed AI tools, shows detection status, and lets you interactively choose which ones to configure with NotebookLM MCP
  - Detects: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Antigravity, Codex
  - Shows which tools are already configured vs. newly detected
  - Select `all`, specific numbers, or `none`
- **`nlm setup remove all`** — Remove NotebookLM MCP from all configured tools at once, with explicit confirmation and safety warnings. Uses CLI-first removal (e.g., `claude mcp remove`) where available.

### Changed
- **Codex skill path updated** — `nlm skill install codex` now installs to `~/.agents/skills/nlm-skill/SKILL.md` per [official Codex docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/), replacing the old `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` path. Users with the old installation should run `nlm skill install codex` to reinstall at the correct location.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Cinematic Video Format (Experimental)** — Added support for NotebookLM's new "Cinematic" video format (`video_format="cinematic"`, format code `3`). This format produces higher-fidelity video overviews and is available to NotebookLM Plus/Ultra subscribers. Thanks to **@ovai-felix** for the detailed reverse-engineering and verified payload structure (Issue #79).
  - Core: Cinematic payloads use a 5-element inner options array (omitting `visual_style_code`), while Explainer/Brief continue to use 6 elements
  - MCP: `studio_create` with `video_format="cinematic"` 
  - CLI: `nlm video create <notebook> --format cinematic`
  - ⚠️ **Note for free/Pro users:** Cinematic is gated behind NotebookLM Plus/Ultra. Free and Pro tier users will see: `"NotebookLM rejected video creation. Try again later or create from NotebookLM UI for diagnosis."` — this is expected behavior, not a bug.

### Fixed
- **Claude Desktop `.mcpb` extension disconnects (Issue #78)** — The `.mcpb` bundle was incomplete (only contained `manifest.json` with no entrypoint) and relied on `uvx` being in PATH, which Claude Desktop's restricted macOS environment doesn't expose. Fixed by bundling a cross-platform Python launcher (`run_server.py`) that defensively resolves `uvx` across common install locations (`~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, etc.) and using `${__dirname}` for reliable path resolution. Thanks to **@abanoub-ashraf** for the detailed diagnosis and reproduction steps.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Bulk Sharing (`notebook_share_batch`)** — Invite multiple collaborators to a notebook in a single API call (Issue #73). Supports mixed roles (viewer/editor) per recipient.
  - Core: `add_collaborators_bulk(notebook_id, recipients)` on `SharingMixin`
  - Service: `invite_collaborators_bulk(client, notebook_id, recipients)` with upfront validation
  - MCP: `notebook_share_batch` tool with `recipients` list and `confirm` flag
  - CLI: `nlm share batch <notebook> "a@gmail.com,b@gmail.com" --role viewer`
- **10 new unit tests** for bulk sharing (core + services)

### Fixed
- **Version mismatch (Patch)** — Bump internal `__version__` string in `__init__.py` to correctly report version (was omitted in `0.3.20` release).

## [0.3.20] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Type errors, thread safety, and silent exceptions (PR #74)**
  - Added Double-Checked Locking (`threading.Lock`) for thread-safe client initialization in MCP tools.
  - Surfaced previously swallowed exceptions for better debug visibility via `logger.debug()`.
  - Fixed multiple type annotations (`str = None` -> `str | None = None`) across the codebase.
  - Replaced unreachable code with explicit `ValidationError` throwing to ensure strict type checking completeness.
  - Thanks to **@adlewis82** for the excellent cleanup and safety improvements!

## [0.3.19] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **JSON output word wrapping (Issue #72)** — CLI commands using `-j` flag (`note list`, `share status`, `export artifact`, `config show`) were producing invalid JSON due to Rich console wrapping long strings at terminal width. JSON output now bypasses Rich and goes directly to stdout. Thanks to **@pjeby** for reporting.

## [0.3.18] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Infographic visual styles** — Infographics now support 11 visual styles matching the NotebookLM web UI: `auto_select`, `sketch_note`, `professional`, `bento_grid`, `editorial`, `instructional`, `bricks`, `clay`, `anime`, `kawaii`, `scientific`. Available via MCP (`infographic_style` parameter on `studio_create`), CLI (`--style` flag on `nlm infographic create`), and Python API (`visual_style_code` on `create_infographic()`). Default is `auto_select` for backward compatibility.

## [0.3.17] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Multi-browser support for `nlm login`** — `nlm login` now detects and launches any Chromium-based browser, not just Google Chrome. Supported browsers (in priority order): Google Chrome, Arc (macOS), Brave, Microsoft Edge, Chromium, Vivaldi, Opera. Checks both system and user-local install paths. Error messages now dynamically list supported browsers per platform. Thanks to **@devnull03** for this contribution (PR #70).
- **Browser preference setting** — Users can now control which browser `nlm login` uses via `nlm config set auth.browser <name>`. Valid values: `auto` (default, first found wins), `chrome`, `arc`, `brave`, `edge`, `chromium`, `vivaldi`, `opera`. Falls back to auto-detection if the preferred browser is not installed. Also settable via `NLM_BROWSER` env var.

### Fixed
- **Deep research task_id mismatch (Issue #69)** — `nlm research status <nb> --task-id <id>` returned "no research found" for deep research because the backend assigns a new task_id internally. Now falls back to returning the only active task when the original task_id doesn't match. Thanks to **@danielbrodie** for reporting.

## [0.3.16] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **Chrome profile isolation bug**: `nlm login` could reuse a Chrome instance from a different NLM profile. Implemented port-to-profile mapping to guarantee strict cross-profile isolation.
- **Auto-retry on Google account mismatch**: When switching NLM profiles (or when multiple users log in on the same machine), Chrome can cache the wrong Google login. The builtin login provider now detects `AccountMismatchError`, automatically clears the stale Chrome user-data-dir, and relaunches Chrome for a fresh Google sign-in.
- **`nlm login profile delete` validation**: Profile deletion was failing for broken/invalid profiles because it strictly checked for valid cookies. Now it checks if the profile directory exists, allowing deletion of empty/corrupt profiles.

## [0.3.15] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **`nlm setup add json` — Interactive JSON config generator** — Run `nlm setup add json` to generate an MCP JSON config snippet for any tool not directly supported. Interactive wizard with numbered prompts lets you choose uvx vs regular mode, full path vs command name, and whether to include the `mcpServers` wrapper. Prints syntax-highlighted JSON and offers clipboard copy on macOS.

## [0.3.14] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **MCP server instructions: incorrect parameter names** — The consolidated tools summary in the MCP server instructions advertised `type=` for `source_add`, `studio_create`, and `download_artifact`, but the actual tool schemas use `source_type` and `artifact_type`. AI clients reading the instructions would use wrong parameter names, causing validation errors. Also added value parameter hints for `source_add`.

## [0.3.13] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Bulk Source Add** — Add multiple URL sources in a single API call, dramatically reducing round-trips and avoiding rate limits (Issue #57).
  - Core: `add_url_sources(notebook_id, urls)` on `SourceMixin`
  - Service: `add_sources(client, notebook_id, sources)` — batches URL sources automatically, falls back to individual calls for other types
  - MCP: `source_add` now accepts optional `urls` list parameter for bulk URL add
  - CLI: `nlm source add <notebook> --url https://a.com --url https://b.com` (repeatable `--url` flag)
- **Bulk Source Delete** — Delete multiple sources in a single API call.
  - Core: `delete_sources(source_ids)` on `SourceMixin`
  - Service: `delete_sources(client, source_ids)` with validation
  - MCP: `source_delete` now accepts optional `source_ids` list parameter for bulk delete
  - CLI: `nlm source delete <id1> <id2> <id3> --confirm` (variadic arguments)
- **12 new unit tests** for bulk add/delete service functions (total: 443 tests)

## [Unreleased / 0.3.12]

### Fixed
- **Source additions bypassing Token Refresh** - Refactored `add_url_source`, `add_drive_source`, `add_text_source`, and multiple other methods in `core/sources.py` to use the unified `_call_rpc` mechanism instead of raw `client.post` requests. This ensures that adding sources now properly benefits from the automatic session/CSRF token refresh if authentication unexpectedly expires (Issue #62).
- **Notebook operations bypassing Token Refresh** - Refactored `list_notebooks` and `delete_notebook` in `core/notebooks.py` to use `_call_rpc`, ensuring they recover from expired CSRF tokens just like other core operations. Thanks to **@byingyang** for identifying this in PR #61.
- **OpenClaw skill path** - Fixed incorrect installation path for OpenClaw skills (`workplace` -> `workspace`) in code and documentation. Thanks to **@maxcanada** for reporting (Issue #63).
- **`create slides` default format** - Fixed a bug where `create slides` would error because it used an invalid format fallback. It now correctly defaults to `detailed_deck`. Added comprehensive tests for all verb defaults. (PR #64)

## [0.3.11] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Auto-extract build label (`bl`)** - The `bl` URL parameter is now automatically extracted from the NotebookLM page during `nlm login` and CSRF token refresh, instead of using a hardcoded value that goes stale every few weeks. This keeps API requests current with Google's latest build without any manual steps. The `NOTEBOOKLM_BL` env var still works as an override. The `save_auth_tokens` MCP tool also extracts `bl` from the `request_url` parameter when provided.

### Fixed
- **`sources_used` now populated in query responses** - The `sources_used` field was always returning `[]` even when the AI's answer contained citation markers like `[1]`, `[2]`. Google's response includes citation-to-source mapping data that was present but never parsed. Query responses now correctly return `sources_used` (list of cited source IDs) and `citations` (dict mapping each citation number to its parent source ID). This also enables the REPL's citation legend feature. Thanks to **@MinhDung2209** for reporting (issue #57).

## [0.3.10] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Source Rename (`source_rename`)** — Rename any source within a notebook via new RPC `b7Wfje`.
  - MCP tool: `source_rename` with `notebook_id`, `source_id`, and `new_title` params
  - CLI: `nlm source rename <source-id> <title> --notebook <notebook-id>`
  - Verb-first alias: `nlm rename source <source-id> <title> --notebook <notebook-id>`

## [0.3.9] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **`--clear` flag for `nlm login`** - Added a `--clear` flag that wipes the cached Chrome profile before logging in. This solves an issue where `nlm login` would auto-login to an old, cached account without letting the user switch profiles or emails.

### Fixed
- **Accurate Email Extraction** - Fixed a bug in `extract_email` where the CLI would sometimes grab a shared note author's email off the dashboard instead of the logged-in user. The regex now prioritizes actual internal Google account fields before falling back to generic matching.
- **Skipping Migration on Clear** - Fixed an issue where using `--clear` would cause the CLI to mistakenly run a migration step from older CLI versions, reinstating the wrong account profile.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **CLI `--debug` Flag** - `nlm --debug <command>` enables debug logging across all CLI commands, showing raw API responses and internal state. Useful for diagnosing API issues.

### Fixed
- **Google API errors no longer silently swallowed** - When Google returns an error response (e.g., `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `UserDisplayableError`) instead of an answer, the CLI now surfaces a clear error message instead of returning an empty answer. Previously, queries would succeed with `{'answer': ''}` and no indication of what went wrong. Thanks to **@MinhDung2209** for the detailed debugging that uncovered this (issue #57).

## [0.3.7] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Configurable Interface Language (`NOTEBOOKLM_HL`)** - Set `NOTEBOOKLM_HL` env var to control both the API's `hl` URL parameter and the default artifact creation language. Explicit `--language` flags still take priority. Thanks to **@beausea** for this contribution (PR #59, closes #58).

## [0.3.6] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Query Timeout Flag** - `nlm notebook query` and `nlm query notebook` now accept `--timeout` / `-t` to set query timeout in seconds (default: 120). Useful for long extraction prompts that need more processing time (closes #57).

## [0.3.5] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Slide Deck Revision (`studio_revise`)** — Revise individual slides in an existing slide deck via new RPC `KmcKPe`. Creates a new artifact with revisions applied; original is never modified.
  - MCP tool: `studio_revise` with `artifact_id`, `slide_instructions`, and `confirm` params
  - CLI: `nlm slides revise <artifact-id> --slide '1 Make the title larger' --confirm`
- **PPTX Download Support** — Download slide decks as PowerPoint (PPTX) in addition to PDF.
  - CLI: `nlm download slide-deck <notebook> --format pptx`
  - MCP: `download_artifact` with `slide_deck_format="pptx"`
- **Login Profile Protection** — Account mismatch guard prevents accidentally overwriting a profile with credentials from a different Google account. Use `--force` to override.
- **Reused Chrome Warning** — `nlm login` now warns when connecting to an existing Chrome instance instead of launching a fresh one.

### Changed
- **Faster Login** — Connection pooling and reduced sleep durations cut `nlm login` time from ~25s to under 3s. Thanks to **@pjeby** for this contribution (PR #54).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **`nlm login` hang on fresh install** - Optimized Chrome port availability scanning (using `socket.bind` instead of `httpx.get`) to avoid 20+ second timeouts on systems that drop network packets. Thanks to **@pjeby** for the diagnosis (closes #52)
- **Chrome "Restore Pages" Warning** - `nlm login` and headless authentication now perform a graceful shutdown of Chrome via CDP (`Browser.close`) rather than abruptly killing the process, resolving crashes on next browser start. Again, great work by **@pjeby** (fixes #52)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- **OpenClaw skill path** - Fixed incorrect installation path for OpenClaw skills. Now correctly uses `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` instead of `~/.openclaw/skills/`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Focus Prompt Support** - Added `--focus` parameter to `nlm quiz create` and `nlm flashcards create` commands to specify custom instructions.
- **Improved Prompt Extraction** - `studio_status` now correctly extracts custom prompts for all artifact types (Audio, Video, Slides, Quiz, Flashcards).

### Fixed
- **Quiz/Flashcard Prompt Extraction** - Fixed a bug where custom instructions were not being extracted for Quiz and Flashcards artifacts (wrong API index).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **New AI Client Support** — Added `nlm skill install` support for:
  - **Cline** (`~/.cline/skills`) - Terminal-based AI agent
  - **Antigravity** (`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills`) - Advanced agentic framework
  - **OpenClaw** (`~/.openclaw/workspace/skills`) - Autonomous AI agent
  - **Codex** (`~/.codex/AGENTS.md`) - Now with version tracking
- **`nlm setup` support** — Added automatic MCP configuration for:
  - **Cline** (`nlm setup add cline`)
  - **Antigravity** (`nlm setup add antigravity`)
- **`nlm skill update` command** - Update installed AI skills to the latest version. Supports updating all skills or specific tools (e.g., `nlm skill update claude-code`).
- **Verb-first alias** - `nlm update skill` works identically to `nlm skill update`.
- **Version tracking** - `AGENTS.md` formats now support version tracking via injected comments.

### Fixed
- **Skill version validation** - `nlm skill list` now correctly identifies outdated skills and prevents "unknown" version status for Codex.
- **Package version** - Bumped to `0.3.1` to match release tag.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Shared service layer** (`services/`) — 10 domain modules centralizing all business logic previously duplicated across CLI and MCP:
  - `errors.py`: Custom error hierarchy (`ServiceError`, `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `CreationError`, `ExportError`)
  - `chat.py`: Chat configuration and notebook query logic
  - `downloads.py`: Artifact downloading with type/format resolution
  - `exports.py`: Google Docs/Sheets export
  - `notebooks.py`: Notebook CRUD, describe, query consolidation
  - `notes.py`: Note CRUD operations
  - `research.py`: Research start, polling, and source import
  - `sharing.py`: Public link, invite, and status management
  - `sources.py`: Source add/list/sync/delete with type validation
  - `studio.py`: Unified artifact creation (all 9 types), status, rename, delete
- **372 unit tests** covering all service modules (up from 331)

### Changed
- **Architecture: strict layering** — `cli/` and `mcp/` are now thin wrappers delegating to `services/`. Neither imports from `core/` directly.
- **MCP tools refactored** — Significant line count reductions across all tool files (e.g., studio 461→200 lines)
- **CLI commands refactored** — Business logic extracted to services, CLI retains only UX concerns (prompts, spinners, formatting)
- **Contributing workflow updated** — New features follow: `core/client.py` → `services/*.py` → `mcp/tools/*.py` + `cli/commands/*.py` → `tests/services/`

## [0.2.22] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **Fail-fast for all studio create commands** — Audio, report, quiz, flashcards, slides, video, and data-table creation now exit non-zero with a clear error when the backend returns no artifact, instead of silently reporting success. Extends the infographic fix from v0.2.21 to all artifact types (closes #33)

## [0.2.21] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **OpenClaw CDP login provider** — `nlm login --provider openclaw --cdp-url <url>` allows authentication via an already-running Chrome CDP endpoint (e.g., OpenClaw-managed browser sessions) instead of launching a separate Chrome instance. Thanks to **@kmfb** for this contribution (PR #47)
- **CLI Guide documentation for `nlm setup` and `nlm doctor`** — Added Setup and Doctor command reference sections, updated workflow example, and added tips. Cherry-picked from PR #48 by **@997unix**

### Fixed
- **Infographic create false success** — `nlm infographic create` now exits non-zero with a clear error when the backend returns `UserDisplayableError` and no artifact, instead of silently reporting success (closes #46). Thanks to **@kmfb** (PR #47)
- **Studio status code 4 mapping** — Studio artifact status code `4` now maps to `"failed"` instead of `"unknown"`, making artifact failures visible during polling. By **@kmfb** (PR #47)

### Changed
- **CDP websocket compatibility** — WebSocket connections now use `suppress_origin=True` for compatibility with managed Chrome endpoints, with fallback for older `websocket-client` versions

## [0.2.20] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Claude Desktop Extension detection** — `nlm setup list` and `nlm doctor` now detect NotebookLM when installed as a Claude Desktop Extension (`.mcpb`), showing version and enabled state.

### Fixed
- **Shell tab completion crash** — Fixed `nlm setup add <TAB>` crashing with `TypeError` due to incorrect completion callback signature.

## [0.2.19] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Automatic retry on server errors** — Transient errors (429, 500, 502, 503, 504) are now retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff. Special thanks to **@sebsnyk** for the suggestion in #42.
- **`--json` flag for more commands** — Added structured JSON output to `notebook describe`, `notebook query`, `source describe`, and `source content`. JSON output is also auto-detected when piping. Thanks to **@sebsnyk** for the request in #43.

### Changed
- **Error handling priority** — Server error retry now executes *before* authentication recovery.
- **AI docs & Skills updated** — specific documentation on retry behavior and expanded `--json` flags.

## [0.2.18] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Claude Desktop Extension (.mcpb)** — One-click install for Claude Desktop. Download the `.mcpb` file from the release page, double-click to install. No manual config editing required.
- **MCPB build automation** — `scripts/build_mcpb.py` reads version from `pyproject.toml`, syncs `manifest.json`, and packages the `.mcpb` file. Old builds are auto-cleaned.
- **GitHub Actions release asset** — `.mcpb` file is automatically built and attached to GitHub Releases alongside PyPI publish.
- **`nlm doctor` and `nlm setup` documentation** — Added to AI docs (`nlm --ai`) and skill file.

### Changed
- **Manifest uses `uvx`** — Claude Desktop extension now uses `uvx --from notebooklm-mcp-cli notebooklm-mcp` for universal PATH compatibility.

### Removed
- Cleaned up `PROJECT_RECAP.md` and `todo.md` (outdated development artifacts).

## [0.2.17] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **`nlm setup` command** - Automatically configure NotebookLM MCP for AI tools (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf). No more manual JSON editing! Thanks to **@997unix** for this contribution (PR #39)
  - `nlm setup list` - Show configuration status for all supported clients
  - `nlm setup add <client>` - Add MCP server config to a client
  - `nlm setup remove <client>` - Remove MCP server config
- **`nlm doctor` command** - Diagnose installation and configuration issues in one command. Checks authentication, Chrome profiles, and AI tool configurations. Also by **@997unix** (PR #39)

### Fixed
- **Version check not running** - Update notifications were never shown after CLI commands because `typer.Exit` exceptions bypassed the check. Moved `print_update_notification()` to a `finally` block so it always runs.
- **Missing import in setup.py** - Fixed `import os` placement for Windows compatibility

## [0.2.16] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Windows JSON parse errors** - Added `show_banner=False` to `mcp.run()` to prevent FastMCP banner from corrupting stdio JSON-RPC protocol on Windows (fixes #35)
- **Stdout pollution in MCP mode** - Replaced `print()` with logging in `auth.py` and `notebooks.py` to avoid corrupting JSON-RPC output
- **Profile handling in login check** - Fixed `nlm login --check` to use config's `default_profile` instead of hardcoded "default"

## [0.2.15] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **Chat REPL command broken** - Fixed `nlm chat start` failing with `TypeError: BaseClient.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'profile'`. Now uses proper `get_client(profile)` utility and handles dict/list API responses correctly. Thanks to **@eng-M-A-AbelLatif** for the detailed bug report and fix in issue #25!

### Removed
- **Dead code cleanup** - Removed unused `src/notebooklm_mcp/` directory. This legacy code was not packaged or distributed but caused confusion (e.g., PR #29 targeted it thinking it was active). The active MCP server is `notebooklm_tools.mcp.server`. Thanks to **@NOirBRight** for PR #29 which helped identify this dead code.

### Changed
- **Updated tests** - Removed references to deleted `notebooklm_mcp` package from test suite.

### Community Contributors
This release also acknowledges past community contributions that weren't properly thanked:
- **@latuannetnam** for HTTP transport support, debug logging, and query timeout configuration (PR #12)
- **@davidszp** for Linux Chrome detection fix (PR #6) and source_get_content tool (PR #1)
- **@saitrogen** for the research polling query fallback fix (PR #15)

## [0.2.14] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **Automatic migration from old location** - Auth tokens and Chrome profiles are automatically migrated from `~/.notebooklm-mcp/` to `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/` on first use. Users upgrading from older versions don't need to re-authenticate.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **Unified storage location** - Consolidated all storage to `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/`. Previously some code still referenced the old `~/.notebooklm-mcp/` location, causing confusion. Now everything uses the single unified location.
- **Note**: v0.2.13 was missing migration support - upgrade to v0.2.14 instead.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-02-03

### Removed
- **`notebooklm-mcp-auth` standalone command** - The standalone authentication tool has been officially deprecated and removed. Use `nlm login` instead, which provides all the same functionality with additional features like named profiles. The headless auth for automatic token refresh continues to work behind the scenes.

### Fixed
- **Auth storage inconsistency** - Previously, `notebooklm-mcp-auth` stored tokens in a different location than `nlm login`, causing "Authentication expired" errors. Now there's only one auth path via `nlm login`.
- **Documentation typo** - Fixed `nlm download slides` → `nlm download slide-deck` in CLI guide.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **`nlm login` not launching Chrome** - Running `nlm login` without arguments now properly launches Chrome for authentication instead of showing help. Workaround for v0.2.10: use `nlm login -p default`.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **Version mismatch** - Synchronized version numbers across all package files

## [0.2.9] - 2026-01-31

### Changed
- **Documentation alignment** - Unified MCP and CLI documentation with comprehensive test plan
- **Build configuration** - Moved dev dependencies to optional-dependencies for standard compatibility

### Fixed
- **Studio custom focus prompt** - Extract custom focus prompt from correct position in API response

## [0.2.7] - 2026-01-30

### Removed
- **Redundant CLI commands** - Removed `nlm download-verb` and `nlm research-verb` (use `nlm download` and `nlm research` instead)

### Fixed
- **Documentation alignment** - Synchronized all CLI documentation with actual CLI behavior:
  - Fixed export command syntax: `nlm export to-docs` / `nlm export to-sheets` (not `docs`/`sheets`)
  - Fixed download command syntax: use `-o` flag for output path
  - Fixed slides format values: `detailed_deck` / `presenter_slides` (not `detailed`/`presenter`)
  - Removed non-existent `nlm mindmap list` from documentation

## [0.2.6] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed
- **Source List Display**: Fixed source list showing empty type by using `source_type_name` key correctly

## [0.2.5] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Unified Note Tool** - Consolidated 4 separate note tools (`note_create`, `note_list`, `note_update`, `note_delete`) into a single `note(action=...)` tool
- **CLI Shell Completion** - Enabled shell tab completion for `nlm skill` tool argument
- **Documentation Updates** - Updated `SKILL.md`, `command_reference.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, and `workflows.md` with latest features

### Fixed
- Fixed `nlm skill install other` automatically switching to project level
- Fixed `research_status` handling of `None` tasks in response
- Fixed note creation returning failure despite success (timing issue with immediate fetch)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Skill Installer for AI Coding Assistants** (`nlm skill` commands)
  - Install NotebookLM skills for Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor, and Codex
  - Support for user-level (`~/.config`) and project-level installation
  - Parent directory validation with smart prompts (create/switch/cancel)

  - Export all formats with `nlm skill install other`
  - Unified CLI/MCP skill with intelligent tool detection logic
  - Consistent `nlm-skill` folder naming across all installations
  - Complete documentation in AI docs (`nlm --ai`)
- Integration tests for all CLI bug fixes (9 tests covering error handling, parameter passing, alias resolution)
- `nlm login profile rename` command for renaming authentication profiles
- **Multi-profile Chrome isolation** - each authentication profile now uses a separate Chrome session, allowing simultaneous logins to multiple Google accounts
- **Email capture during login** - profiles now display associated Google account email in `nlm login profile list`
- **Default profile configuration** - `nlm config set auth.default_profile <name>` to avoid typing `--profile` for every command
- **Auto-cleanup Chrome profile cache** after authentication to save disk space

### Fixed
- Fixed `console.print` using invalid `err=True` parameter (now uses `err_console = Console(stderr=True)`)
- Fixed verb-first commands passing OptionInfo objects instead of parameter values
- Fixed studio command parameter mismatches (format→format_code, length→length_code, etc.)
- Fixed studio methods not handling `source_ids=None` (now defaults to all notebook sources)

### Changed
- **Consolidated auth commands under login** - replaced `nlm auth status/list/delete` with `nlm login --check` and `nlm login profile list/delete/rename`
- Studio commands now work without explicit `--source-ids` parameter (defaults to all sources in notebook)
- Download commands now support notebook aliases (auto-resolved via `get_alias_manager().resolve()`)
- Added `--confirm` flag to `nlm alias delete` command
- Updated all documentation to reflect login command structure

## [0.1.14] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- **Critical Research Stability**:
  - `poll_research` now accepts status code `6` (Imported) as success, fixing "hanging" Fast Research.
  - Added `target_task_id` filtering to `poll_research` to ensure the correct research task is returned (essential for Deep Research).
  - Updated `research_status` and `research_import` to use task ID filtering.
  - `research_status` tool now accepts an optional `task_id` parameter.
- **Missing Source Constants**:
  - Included the code changes for `SOURCE_TYPE_UPLOADED_FILE`, `SOURCE_TYPE_IMAGE`, and `SOURCE_TYPE_WORD_DOC` that were omitted in v0.1.13.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Source type constants** for proper identification of additional source types:
  - `SOURCE_TYPE_UPLOADED_FILE` (11): Direct file uploads (e.g., .docx uploaded directly)

  - Prevents timeout errors when importing large websites or documents

## [0.1.11] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **Close Chrome after interactive authentication** - Chrome is now properly terminated after `notebooklm-mcp-auth` completes, releasing the profile lock and enabling headless auth for automatic token refresh
- **Improve token reload from disk** - Removed the 5-minute timeout when reloading tokens during auth recovery. Previously, cached tokens older than 5 minutes were ignored even if the user had just run `notebooklm-mcp-auth`

These fixes resolve "Authentication expired" errors that occurred even after users re-authenticated.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

- `_call_rpc()` enhanced with `_deep_retry` parameter for multi-layer auth recovery

## [0.1.8] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- `constants.py` module as single source of truth for all API code-name mappings
- `CodeMapper` class with bidirectional lookup (name→code, code→name)
