# Authentication Guide

This guide explains how to authenticate with NotebookLM MCP and CLI.

## Overview

NotebookLM uses browser cookies for authentication (there is no official API). The CLI/MCP extracts these cookies automatically from a managed browser session:
- Chromium-family browsers use Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)

**Supported browsers**: Google Chrome, Arc (macOS), Brave, Microsoft Edge, Chromium, Vivaldi, Opera.

**Two authentication methods are available:**

| Method | Best For | Requires |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Auto Mode** (default) | Most users | Any supported Chromium-family browser installed |
| **File Mode** (`--file`) | Complex setups, troubleshooting | Manual cookie extraction |

---

## Method 1: Auto Mode (Recommended)

This method launches your browser automatically and extracts cookies after you log in.

### Prerequisites

- A supported browser installed (Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge, Chromium, Vivaldi, or Opera)
- Chromium-family browsers should be **completely closed** before running

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Close your browser completely (Cmd+Q on Mac, or quit from taskbar)

# 2. Run the auth command (CLI or standalone)
nlm login                      # Recommended

# 3. Log in to your Google account in the browser window that opens

# 4. Wait for "SUCCESS!" message
```

If your DevTools endpoint is slow to respond, you can increase the timeout:

```bash
nlm login --devtools-timeout 15
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. The first available supported browser is detected (or your preferred browser if configured)
2. A dedicated browser profile is created for authentication
3. The browser launches with the appropriate automation backend
4. You log in to NotebookLM via the browser
5. Cookies, CSRF token, and account email are extracted and cached
6. The browser is closed automatically

### Browser Preference

By default, `nlm login` uses the first available browser. To use a specific browser:

```bash
# Set preferred browser
nlm config set auth.browser brave

# Or use an environment variable
export NLM_BROWSER=arc

# Valid values: auto, chrome, arc, brave, edge, chromium, vivaldi, opera
# If the preferred browser is not installed, falls back to auto-detection.
```

### Persistent Login

The dedicated browser profile persists your Google login:
- **First run:** You must log in to Google
- **Future runs:** Already logged in, just extracts fresh cookies

This profile is separate from your regular browser profile. Chromium profiles disable extensions.

## Multi-Profile Support

Use multiple Google accounts by creating named profiles:

```bash
# Create profiles for different accounts
nlm login --profile work       # Opens browser - log in with work account
nlm login --profile personal   # Opens browser - log in with personal account

# List all profiles
nlm login profile list
# Output:
#   work: jsmith@company.com
#   personal: jsmith@gmail.com

# Switch default profile (no --profile flag needed)
nlm login switch personal
# Output: ✓ Switched default profile to personal

# Use profiles
nlm notebook list                    # Uses default (personal)
nlm notebook list --profile work     # Uses work account

# Manage profiles
nlm login profile rename work company
nlm login profile delete old-profile
```

To refresh every saved profile in sequence:

```bash
nlm login --all-profiles
```

This opens each saved profile's isolated browser session, waits for login if needed, saves fresh credentials, and keeps the browser open for 10 seconds after each successful login. Use `--start-index <n>` to begin from a specific numeric profile, such as `nlm login --all --start-index 8`. If you close the auth browser before login completes, that profile is skipped and the CLI moves to the next one. Use `--stop-on-error` to stop at the first failed profile. Passwords are never read, stored, or typed by the CLI.

### Batch Login from an Email List

For many accounts, create a text file with one email address per line:

```text
first@gmail.com
second@gmail.com
third@gmail.com
```

Then run:

```bash
nlm login batch accounts.txt
```

Profiles continue after the highest existing numeric profile by default. For example, if profiles `1` through `8` already exist, the next run starts at `9`. Use `--start-index` to choose a different starting number. Passwords are never read, stored, or typed by the CLI; each Google sign-in must be completed manually in the browser. Files containing password columns such as `email:password` are rejected.

### How Multi-Profile Works

Each profile gets:
- **Separate credentials**: Stored in `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/profiles/<name>/`
- **Separate browser profile**: Isolated browser session in `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/chrome-profiles/<name>/`
- **Captured email**: Automatically extracted during login for easy identification

This means you can stay logged into multiple Google accounts simultaneously without conflicts.

## Enterprise / Google Workspace

If your organization uses **Google Workspace** with a managed NotebookLM instance (e.g., `notebooklm.cloud.google.com` instead of `notebooklm.google.com`), set the `NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL` environment variable before authenticating:

```bash
# Set the enterprise URL
export NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL=https://notebooklm.cloud.google.com

# Then authenticate as usual
nlm login
```

All CLI commands, MCP tools, and internal API calls will use this URL automatically. If the variable is not set, the default personal URL (`https://notebooklm.google.com`) is used.

> **Tip:** Add the export to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`) so it persists across sessions.

For MCP server configuration, pass the variable in your client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notebooklm-mcp": {
      "command": "notebooklm-mcp",
      "env": {
        "NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL": "https://notebooklm.cloud.google.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Method 2: File Mode

This method lets you manually extract and provide cookies. Use this if:
- Auto mode doesn't work on your system
- You have browser extensions that interfere (e.g., Google Antigravity IDE)
- You prefer manual control

### Steps

```bash
# Option A: Interactive mode (shows instructions, prompts for file path)
nlm login --manual

# Option B: Direct file path
nlm login --manual --file /path/to/cookies.txt
```

### How to Extract Cookies Manually

1. Open Chrome and go to https://notebooklm.google.com
2. Make sure you're logged in
3. Press **F12** (or **Cmd+Option+I** on Mac) to open DevTools
4. Click the **Network** tab
5. In the filter box, type: `batchexecute`
6. Click on any notebook to trigger a request
7. Click on a `batchexecute` request in the list
8. In the right panel, scroll to **Request Headers**
9. Find the line starting with `cookie:`
10. Right-click the cookie **value** and select **Copy value**
11. Paste into a text file and save

### Cookie File Format

The cookie file should contain the raw cookie string from Chrome DevTools:

```
SID=abc123...; HSID=xyz789...; SSID=...; APISID=...; SAPISID=...; __Secure-1PSID=...; ...
```

**Notes:**
- Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored
- The file can contain the cookie string on one or multiple lines
- A template file `cookies.txt` is included in the repository

## Where Tokens Are Stored

All data is stored under `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/`:

```
~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/
├── config.toml                    # CLI configuration
├── aliases.json                   # Notebook aliases
├── profiles/                      # Authentication profiles
│   ├── default/
│   │   └── auth.json              # Cookies, tokens, email
│   ├── work/
│   │   └── auth.json
│   └── personal/
│       └── auth.json
├── chrome-profile/                # Chrome profile (single-profile users)
└── chrome-profiles/               # Chrome profiles (multi-profile users)
    ├── work/
    └── personal/
```

Each profile's `auth.json` contains:
- Parsed cookies
- CSRF token (auto-extracted)
- Session ID (auto-extracted)
- Account email (auto-extracted)
- Extraction timestamp

## After Authentication

Once authenticated, add the MCP to your AI tool:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add notebooklm-mcp -- notebooklm-mcp
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
gemini mcp add notebooklm notebooklm-mcp
```

**Manual (settings.json):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notebooklm-mcp": {
      "command": "notebooklm-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart your AI assistant.

---

## Token Expiration

- **Cookies:** Generally stable for weeks, but some rotate on each request
- **CSRF token:** Auto-refreshed on each MCP client initialization
- **Session ID:** Auto-refreshed on each MCP client initialization

When you start seeing authentication errors, simply run `nlm login` again to refresh.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Browser is running but without remote debugging enabled"

Close your browser completely and try again. On Mac, use **Cmd+Q** to fully quit.

### Auto mode fails to connect

Try file mode instead:
```bash
nlm login --manual
```

### "401 Unauthorized" or "403 Forbidden" errors

Your cookies have expired. Run the auth command again to refresh.

### Browser opens with strange branding (e.g., Antigravity IDE)

Some browser extensions or tools modify the browser's behavior. Try a different browser or use file mode:
```bash
nlm login --manual
```

### Cookie file shows "missing required cookies"

Make sure you copied the cookie **value**, not the header name. The value should start with something like `SID=...` not `cookie: SID=...`.

### Authentication loop after `nlm login`

If you keep getting "Authentication expired" even after running `nlm login` or calling `refresh_auth`, check whether `NOTEBOOKLM_COOKIES` is set as an environment variable in your MCP config.

**Why this happens:** When `NOTEBOOKLM_COOKIES` is set in your config (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json`), it takes absolute priority over all other auth sources — `auth.json`, profile cookies, `save_auth_tokens`, and `nlm login`. When those hardcoded cookies expire, no recovery action can fix a running MCP process because the stale env var is baked into its environment.

**How to check:**

```python
import os
print("NOTEBOOKLM_COOKIES in env:", "YES (overrides everything!)" if os.environ.get("NOTEBOOKLM_COOKIES") else "no")
```

**How to fix (pick one):**

1. **Update the cookie value** in your MCP config file with fresh cookies, then restart your AI tool (Claude Desktop, etc.)
2. **Remove the `NOTEBOOKLM_COOKIES` env var** from your config entirely and use `nlm login` instead (recommended — this way auth recovery works automatically)

Similarly, if you have `NOTEBOOKLM_CSRF_TOKEN` or `NOTEBOOKLM_SESSION_ID` in your config, remove them — both are deprecated and auto-extracted. Stale values can prevent auto-refresh from working.

## Chromium 136+ Compatibility

Chrome 136+ (and other Chromium-based browsers at the same version) restrict remote debugging on the default profile for security reasons. This is handled automatically by:

1. Using dedicated profile directories (`~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/chrome-profiles/<name>/`)
2. Adding the `--remote-allow-origins=*` flag for WebSocket connections

No action required from users.

---

## Security Notes

- Cookies are stored locally in `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/profiles/<name>/auth.json`
- Each browser profile contains your Google login for NotebookLM
- Never share your `auth.json` files or commit them to version control
- The `cookies.txt` file in the repo is a template - don't commit real cookies
